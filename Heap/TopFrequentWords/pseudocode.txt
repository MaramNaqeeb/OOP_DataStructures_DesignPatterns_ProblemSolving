Create a hashmap to count the frequency of strings.
Traverse the given array in a for loop.
If the word does not exist in the hashmap, set its frequency to 1, else increment its frequencyb by 1.
Create a min heap using a priority queue to track the top K frequent words.
The queue priority has two parameters 'a' and 'b'.
If the frequency of 'a' and 'b' are different, subtract the frequency of 'a' from the frequency of 'b' to get them in descending order.
If the frequency of 'a' and 'b' is the same, use the built in function compareTo() to order the strings alphabetically.
Traverse the keys of the map and add each word to the minheap.
Traverse the minheap starting from 0 index to k.
Extract the top frequent words from the minheap and add them to the result.
Return the result that contains the top frequent words extracted from the minheap.
